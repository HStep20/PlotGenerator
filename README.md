For those who don't know, Brandon Sanderson is not only a big name fantasy author, but he also teaches a creative writing class at BYU and uploads them to youtube for anyone to watch. His lecture on worldbuilding this year detailed a specific way of creating plot/conflict via worldbuilding aspects, so I created a bot to create prompts based on it.

You can see his examples using this method [at this video timestamp](https://youtu.be/V2KpWOLTXx8?list=PLSH_xM-KC3Zv-79sVZTTj-YA6IAqh8qeQ&t=3363).

Basically, you take a few aspects of the worldbuilding, and tie them to your plot. One example they come up with is a horror book where money plays a role in it. So they go on 'what if' tangents, like 'what if there is a beast constantly hunting people down from a list, but you can pay to put other people's names above yours, or someone does that to you.' 

Its interesting to see how they talk about ways fashion can influence a mystery, or how climate change can influence an Action Adventure.

---------------

As for the Bot, I have set up a [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/BrainstormCent1) as well as a [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainstormPrompts/) for it. They both post the same prompts twice a day at 6am/6pm MST so you only need to watch one of them if you're interested. The subreddit doesn't allow anyone else to submit posts, but everyone should be able to comment and discuss their ideas underneath each.

Some sample outputs include:

- *Brainstorm a Literary book where Races, Weather, Terrain, and Time play a role in the story, and it touches on the theme of Manipulation. Hard mode: Use a Voyage and Return plot structure.*

- *Brainstorm a Fantasy book where Core Values, Visuals, and Currency play a role in the story, and it touches on the theme of Fulfillment. Hard mode: Use a Rebirth plot structure.*

For a *Hard Mode*, I specified plot types that I pulled from [this article.](https://www.how-to-write-a-book-now.com/basic-plots.html)

It also has a gui if you want to compile and run it from your desktop. If you have suggestions of how to make it better, other features that would be cool, or just more words to add to the lists (like the short 'physical worldbuilding aspects'), I'd be more than happy to take ideas on improving it.
